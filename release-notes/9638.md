Uploaded avatar images can sometimes contain unexpected metadata such as the location where the image was created, or the device the image was created with, stored in a format called EXIF. Forgejo now removes EXIF data when custom user and repository images are uploaded in order to reduce the risk of personally identifiable information being leaked unexpectedly. A new CLI subcommand `forgejo doctor avatar-strip-exif` can be used to strip EXIF information from all existing avatars; we recommend that administrators run this command once after upgrade in order to minimize this risk for existing stored files.
