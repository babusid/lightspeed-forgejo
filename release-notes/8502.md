Forgejo Actions workflows are verified with a YAML schema and common errors such as using an incorrect context (e.g. `${{ badcontext.FORGEJO_REPOSITORY }}`) or a typo in a required keyword (e.g. `ruins-on:` instead of `runs-on:`) will be reported in the action page and the web page that displays the file in the repository. It is recommended to verify existing workflows are successfully verified prior to upgrading, [as explained in the Forgejo runner release notes](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo/runner/src/branch/main/RELEASE-NOTES.md#8-0-0).
